# Trackr: Decentralized Supply Chain Management System

## Overview

**Trackr** is a decentralized supply chain management platform built using Clarity smart contracts. It ensures transparency, traceability, and security from manufacturers to consumers, automating the verification of product information and facilitating seamless payments. By using blockchain, Trackr enhances trust in the supply chain by providing tamper-proof records of each transaction and step involved in the product's journey.

---

## Features

1. **Manufacturer Registration and Verification**  
   Manufacturers can register on the platform, and their identities can be verified by the contract owner.
   
2. **Product Creation**  
   Verified manufacturers can create new products and add them to the blockchain with details such as sustainability status, price, and timestamp.

3. **Supply Chain Tracking**  
   The movement of products through the supply chain is recorded on the blockchain, with each step documented, including handler, location, and timestamp.

4. **Product Transfer**  
   Products can be securely transferred from one entity to another, with records updated on the blockchain for transparency.

5. **Payment Processing**  
   Payments for products are automated using Stacks tokens (STX), and the contract facilitates payments directly between buyers and manufacturers.

6. **Sustainability Verification**  
   Trackr allows consumers to verify whether a product is marked as sustainable, ensuring transparency in eco-friendly claims.

## Smart Contract Breakdown

### 1. Constants

- **contract-owner**: The owner of the contract who manages manufacturer verification.
- **error codes**: Various error codes to handle unauthorized access and invalid operations.

### 2. Data Types

- **last-product-id**: A data variable used to track the product ID of the last created product.

### 3. Data Structures

- **manufacturers**: A map that stores information about registered manufacturers, including their name and verification status.
- **products**: A map that stores information about products such as the manufacturer, product name, current status, current holder, timestamp, sustainability status, and price.
- **supply-chain-steps**: A map that records each step in the supply chain process, including the handler, location, timestamp, and verification status of the step.

### 4. Read-only Functions

- **get-product-details(product-id)**: Retrieves the details of a product based on its ID.
- **get-manufacturer(address)**: Fetches the manufacturer details by address.
- **get-supply-chain-step(product-id, step-number)**: Retrieves a specific step in the supply chain for a product.

### 5. Manufacturer Management Functions

- **register-manufacturer(name)**: Allows a manufacturer to register with the system.
- **verify-manufacturer(manufacturer)**: Allows the contract owner to verify a registered manufacturer.

### 6. Product Management Functions

- **create-product(name, sustainable, price)**: Allows a verified manufacturer to create a new product on the platform, setting its initial status and price.

### 7. Supply Chain Functions

- **add-supply-chain-step(product-id, step-number, location)**: Adds a step to a product’s supply chain, recording details such as handler and location.
- **transfer-product(product-id, recipient)**: Allows the current holder to transfer the product to a new holder.

### 8. Payment Processing

- **process-payment(product-id)**: Facilitates payment processing using STX tokens, updating the product status once payment is successful.

### 9. Sustainability Verification

- **verify-sustainability(product-id)**: Allows anyone to verify the sustainability status of a product.

## Contract Interaction

### Manufacturer Registration

1. A manufacturer registers by calling the `register-manufacturer` function with their name.
2. The contract owner verifies the manufacturer using the `verify-manufacturer` function.

### Product Creation

1. A verified manufacturer calls the `create-product` function, providing details like the product's name, sustainability status, and price.
2. The system assigns a unique product ID to the newly created product.

### Adding a Supply Chain Step

1. The current holder of the product calls the `add-supply-chain-step` function to log details about the current step (e.g., location, handler).
2. Each step is recorded with a unique step number.

### Transferring a Product

1. The current holder calls the `transfer-product` function, specifying the recipient's address.
2. The product’s status is updated to reflect the transfer.

### Processing Payment

1. The buyer calls the `process-payment` function, transferring the required amount of STX tokens to the manufacturer.
2. Once payment is complete, the product status is marked as "paid."

### Verifying Sustainability

1. Anyone can call the `verify-sustainability` function with a product ID to confirm if the product is marked as sustainable.

## Error Codes

- **err-owner-only (u100)**: Only the contract owner can perform this action.
- **err-not-manufacturer (u101)**: The caller is not a registered manufacturer.
- **err-invalid-product (u102)**: The specified product does not exist.
- **err-invalid-status (u103)**: The provided status is invalid.
- **err-unauthorized (u104)**: The caller is not authorized to perform this action.
- **err-already-exists (u105)**: The manufacturer or product already exists.

## Security and Transparency

By leveraging blockchain technology, **Trackr** ensures that all product-related data is immutable, tamper-proof, and transparently recorded. Each product step, transfer, and payment is visible on the blockchain, promoting trust and accountability in the supply chain.

## Future Enhancements

In future updates, **Trackr** could include:

- **AI-driven analytics** for predictive insights into supply chain efficiency.
- **IoT integration** for real-time tracking of physical goods.
- **Dynamic pricing mechanisms** based on demand, location, or other factors.
- **Extended verification steps** for validating product authenticity at various points in the supply chain.

## Conclusion

Trackr brings transparency, accountability, and automation to supply chain management through blockchain technology. It empowers manufacturers, intermediaries, and consumers to participate in a trusted, decentralized network that tracks the entire lifecycle of a product from creation to final delivery.
